        Add a database along with additional schema description provided through
        @schemaFile.

        @param schemaFile    ascii file containing schema with description
        @param level         level (e.g., L1, L2, L3)

        @param accessibility accessibility of the database (pending/public/private)
        @param projectName   name of the project the db is associated with
        @param dbMysqlAuthF  mysql auth file for the db that we are adding

        The function connects to two database servers:
        a) one that has the database that is being loaded
        b) one that has the metaserv database
        If they are both on the same server, the connection is reused.

        The course of action:
        * connect to the server that has database that is being loaded
        * parse the ascii schema file
        * fetch schema information from the information_schema
        * do the matching, add info fetched from information_schema to the
          in memory structure produced by parsing ascii schema file
        * fetch schema description and version (which is kept as data inside
          a special table in the database that is being loaded). Ignore if it
          does not exist.
        * Capture information from mysql auth file about connection information
        * connect to the metaserv database
        * validate owner, project (these must be loaded into metaserv prior to
        calling this function)
        * load all the information into metaserv in various tables (Repo,
          DDT_Table, DDT_Column)

        It raises following MetaBEXceptions:
        * DB_DOES_NOT_EXISTS if database dbName does not exist
        * NOT_MATCHING if the database schema and ascii schema don't match
        * TB_NOT_IN_DB if the table is described in ascii schema, but it is missing
                       in the database
        * COL_NOT_IN_TB if the column is described in ascii schema, but it is
                        missing in the database
        * COL_NOT_IN_FL if the column is in the database schema, but not in ascii
                        schema
        * Db object can throw various DbException and MySQL exceptions
